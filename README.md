- 👋 Hi, I’m @RachaelSara
- 👀 I’m interested in art, literature, plants, empathy and justice.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use data to answer questions and how to format a resume through Merit America. I'm also teaching myself Python. An annoying owl thinks it's teaching me Spanish.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making the world a better place.
- 📫 How to reach me: rachaelsarafink@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her/they/them
